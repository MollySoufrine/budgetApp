Building an expense tracker with React hooks.

For this application i followed a video in order to become better versed with how hooks and state work.

The purpose of this app is to help keep track of your budget. You can add your income or money made but also put in your expenses.

The app takes both into account and will relay your balance at the top. It also keeps a list of your transactions so you're always up to date.

The benefit of this would be to track how much you're spending vs what you are making and saving. I'd like to add a DB to this application and eventully allow it to store and save your information.
